'''
Write a number guessing game. Keep asking the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 until they guess correctly.
If the number the user guesses is too high, tell them so. Same with if the number is too low.
Congratulate them when theyâ€™ve guessed the correct number and tell them how many guesses they used to get to the correct number.

Write a function that takes in two lists of words and returns a list of the words common to both original lists.
For example, given ["hello", "adios", "goodbye", "hola", "au revoir", "bonjour"] and 
["hello", "welcome","thanks", "goodbye", "please"], 
return ["hello", "goodbye"].

Write a function that takes in 3 integers as arguments and returns a list of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), 
containing only integers that are evenly divisible by at least one of the integers.
For example, given 50, 30, and 29, return [29, 30, 50, 58, 60, 87, 90, 100].
